## Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 2025

tripm.app ("we", "us", or "the app") is a client-side web application that helps you visualise your travel history. Your privacy is important to us.

### Data we collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.** All calendar data you import is processed entirely within your browser.

- **Calendar data** — When you import a calendar file or paste iCal data, the content is parsed locally in your browser to extract travel events. The raw calendar data is never sent to any server.
- **Travel history** — Extracted country visits are stored in your browser's localStorage. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.
- **Google Calendar access** — If you choose to connect your Google Calendar, we request read-only access to your calendar events. This data is fetched directly to your browser and processed locally. We do not store your Google credentials or calendar data on any server.

### Data protection

All data is processed locally in your browser and no data is transmitted to or stored on any server. Connections to third-party services (Google OAuth, MapBox) are encrypted. Data stored in localStorage remains on your device and under your control.

### Data sharing

We do not share any data with third parties. Since we do not collect data, there is nothing to share.

### Third-party services

- **MapBox** — We use MapBox to render the interactive map. MapBox may collect anonymous usage data according to their own privacy policy.
- **Google OAuth** — If you use the Google Calendar import feature, authentication is handled by Google's OAuth 2.0 service. We only request the minimum scopes necessary to read your calendar events.

### Data retention

All data is stored locally in your browser. You can delete it at any time by using the "Reset" button in the app or by clearing your browser's site data.

### Changes to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.
